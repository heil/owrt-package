Subject: [PATCH 2/2] MEDIUM: session: disable lingering on the server when the
 client aborts

When abortonclose is used and an error is detected on the client side,
better force an RST to the server. That way we propagate to the server
the same vision we got from the client, and we ensure that we won't keep
TIME_WAITs.
