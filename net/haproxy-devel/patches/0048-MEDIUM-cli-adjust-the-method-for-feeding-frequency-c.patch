Subject: [PATCH 048/179] MEDIUM: cli: adjust the method for feeding frequency
 counters in tables

Since commit 654694e1, it has been possible to feed some data into
stick tables from the CLI. That commit considered that frequency
counters would only have their previous value set, so that they
progressively fade out. But this does not match any real world
use case in fact. The only reason for feeding a freq counter is
to pass some data learned outside. We certainly don't want to see
such data start to vanish immediately, otherwise it will force the
external scripts to loop very frequently to limit the losses.

So let's set the current value instead in order to guarantee that
the data remains stable over the full period, then starts to fade
out between 1* and 2* the period.
